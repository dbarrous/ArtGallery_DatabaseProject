# ArtGallery_DatabaseProject
The project will be creating a database for a fictional Art Gallery that they can use to manage all of the artwork they have in their system as well as those customers who purchase the artwork. The project would be a good example on how a database could improve the organization of a business such as an Art Gallery.
